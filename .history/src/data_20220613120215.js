    body: '<p>Our University has organized a Hackathon few days ago. Usually, they provide us some problems and we have to solve them using some major languages like C, C++, Java or Python. But They didn’t keep the option for JavaScript. I was asking one of the coordinator whether I could use JavaScript or not. He totally replied negatively and neglected it. He said JavaScript is not programming language, it’s just a scripting language</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oPuNsatmuUkzzAZH.jpg"/></figure><p>So this is how the world’s most famous and powerful Programming Language, JavaScript is misunderstood by everyone. They don’t consider it as Programming Language. And in the mean time, most of us are also confused whether It is actually a programming language like C/C++ or not. So that’s why today I am going to discuss about it.</p><p>JavaScript has been misunderstood. And it is a top open secret that this is actually the most underrated Programming Language. There are several reasons for that. First I am focusing on those reasons:</p><ol><li>The JavaScript name itself is confusing. Most of the time people think it as a subset of Java programming language.</li><li>Also some people think it as only a scripting language, which is a subset of Java as it is called as JavaScript (Script of Java or something like that)</li><li>JavaScript is very popular among the web as scripting language. Most of us think that this is the only reason why people use it</li><li>The ECMA committee which is responsible for the standard of JavaScript specifications makes very poor quality documentation which is very hard to understand and also people get confused easily</li><li>Most of the JavaScript programmer doesn’t have enough programming basic. They can easily start with JavaScript without even knowing anything about the programming world which lead them to write poor code. As it is very high in number, other people coming from any other programming language think that it is not maintaining programming standards</li><li>The JavaScript is said to be a Object Oriented Programming language, but till its most popular version called ES5, there was the concept of objects which can hold data but there was no concept of class or anything like that what makes most of the people confused</li></ol><p>And there are some other reasons as well. But they are the most highlighted reasons why people get confused and think it as a normal scripting language, not a programming language like C, C++</p><p>Now I am going to discuss what JavaScript is actually and How we can get to know about it whether it is actually a programming language or not:</p><ol><li>JavaScript is not a subset of Java. It doesn’t have any connection with Java. Its syntax is like other major languages most of the time. But it doesn’t mean it is following Java. They are totally two different Programming Language.</li><li>C is the mother of all languages. C will be the same always. But That doesn’t mean JavaScript is not a programming language. Most of the time JavaScript is found to be faster than those languages for using some uncommon strategies.</li><li>JavaScript is mostly used in the web. But it is not the only thing that it can do. Have you ever seen that you can use it for machine learning, you can use it for Arduino as well? I am leaving the discussion on Node JS, because most of the people know about it. But I will discuss about those things that people don’t know about.</li><li>JavaScript is a very nice dynamic and Object Oriented Programming Language and It is very easy to learn actually.</li><li>You will find three time period for the Programming Languages. <strong>Procedural Programming Language &gt; Object Oriented Programming Language &gt; Functional Programming Language</strong>. So, functional programming language is the future now. JavaScript is removing all its weak points in the new versions and also moving toward functional programming language slowly which is very futuristic</li><li>JavaScript’s new specification ES6 has all the concept from Object Oriented Programming Language</li><li>Though amateurs can use JavaScript as it is very easy to learn.

    title: "What is Lorem Ipsum?",
    body: '<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><h2>Why do we use it?</h2><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><h2>Where does it come from?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p><h2>Where can I get some?</h2><p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don\'t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn\'t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

Who you are and where you from, your power can’t break a friendship. I can say, even Hitlar didn’t have this power to break it. It is the toughest relationship in this galaxy.</p><p>I’ve got some friends in my life. They’re the most valuable person to me. There is no other reasons for it, only friendship. Most of the friends I’ve got in my life are very simple in their nature. They’re very friendly. They can sacrifice anything for me. They give me inspirations when I need. In fact I get everything. My life couldn’t be perfect if I didn’t meet some people. I don’t want to mention their name here because I can’t describe them with my bad English. After all, I have to say that I’ve got a best friend circle in the world. We’ve got us, we’ve got each other. Thanks duds for being with me….</p>',
